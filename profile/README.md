# Welcome to Futino!

### Our Mission
Leverage the power of modern technologies and open-source software to design & develop software in a more cost-efficient manner.
### What We Do
At Futino, we specialize in the planning and creation of both software and websites, from start to finish. We also spend our time building our software projects like [Aitino](https://aiti.no).
### Why We Do It
We were inspired to create Futino when we observed that traditional web design & development was almost always too expensive and time-consuming, often leaving smaller businesses at a disadvantage. We wanted the possibility for companies with less upfront resources or companies with less possibility for risk to have access to efficient, top-quality web solutions that wouldn't break the bank and require any risk analysis.
### How We Do It
Our secret sauce lies in harnessing the power of AI & OSS and mixing it with the most modern technologies out there. We infuse AI technology into our design and development processes to streamline workflows and enhance overall efficiency. By doing so, we not only deliver visually stunning websites but also significantly reduce the time and cost associated with web projects.
### Our Pricing Model
Our unique pricing model is also what differentiates us from other web-dev and software companies. Instead of paying highly unpredictable & highly inflated billable hours (also totally determined by the other party), you pay a flat monthly price for a fixed amount of work from us. It is by far a more preferred and just better model for startups and smaller companies.

## Our Main Project - Aitino
Aitino is a groundbreaking SaaS platform developed by Futino, designed to be the ultimate partner. Leveraging the power of multi-LLM-agent environments and seamless integration with other business systems, Aitino is poised to transform how everyone operates. Aitino's capabilities are vast and continuously evolving, from automating routine tasks to conducting complex analyses. The sky really is the limit for Aitino.
### Join the Aitino Community
We're constantly looking for testers, collaborators, and innovators to join us in shaping the future of business operations. Whether you're interested in contributing to Aitino's development, exploring its capabilities as an early adopter, or staying updated on our journey, we welcome you to [Aitino](https://aiti.no).
